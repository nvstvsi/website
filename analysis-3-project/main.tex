% MISSING THEOREMS
% Kirszbraun Extension Theorem for R^n
% Differentiation under the integral sign
% Area Formula
% Coarea Formula
% Stepanov Theorem (Rademacher generalization)

% FILL IN DETAILS FOR LCH SPACES
% Urysohn's Lemma for Normal spaces --- put in LCH spaces note

% TO-DO LIST
% Check that all L^p_{\text{loc}} looks good - defined for Borel outer reg measures which are finite on compact sets (metric spaces?)
% write introduction to ch. 3
% FINISH TWO EXAMPLES IN AC SECTION OF BV ON R / ftoc 
% example of strict inequality of Rademacher's theorem
% in lippy.tex, need to write the proof that the hausdorff dim of a Lipschitz graph is the same as the dimension of the domain
% show L^p_{\text{loc}} is a Frechet space

% add file about C^m space NO CLOSURE
%       prove banach if bounded derivatives, and frechet in general
%       topology does not depend on choice of compact exhaustion
%       meaning of convergence
%       re-organize stuff in whitney extension applications

% largely unfinished files - Lp spaces, modes of convergence, inequality party
%                            area fomula, coarea formula,




% Analysis 1 - real line
    % ch 1 -- the real numbers

    % ch 2 --- sequences and series

    % ch 3 --- Limits and continuity

    % ch 4 --- differentiation on the real line
        % Taylor with remainder
        
    % ch 5 --- Riemann integration
        % fundamental theorem of calculus, lebesgue criterion for riemann integrability, improper integrals


        % specific facts: 
            % if f is a concave function [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty), then f is continuous on  (0,\infty)
            % if f is a concave function [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty) and f(0) = 0, then f is increasing and continuous on [0,\infty)
            % for this DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE CONCAVE FUNCTION IS DIFFERENTIABLE, go straight from defn of concavity to the desired properties

            % Hadamard's lemma
